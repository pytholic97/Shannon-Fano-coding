# Title

[Shannon-Fano encoder/decoder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Fano_coding)

# Details

C program that encodes **_input.txt_** and stores result in **_output.txt_**.
Decoder stores decoded(original) file in **_results.txt_**.

For sake of flexibility and experimentation, the encoding requires as input, the probabilites
of each unique symbol present in the input file. It considers these probabilites in order
to construct the coding tree and not the actual probabilities of the symbols in the input file.
